# Words Prediction: Shakespeare's-sonnets
The goal of the project was to implement a **Deep Neural Network**, using **TensorFlow**, to predict the next word in a text sequence, using a corpus of Shakespeare's sonnets.

This assignment is part of the "DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer" course.

## Deep Neural Network Architecture
The model is comprised of a sequential group of layers, as follows:
- Embedding
- Bidirectional LSTM
- Dense

## Data
The original data set is the following:  
-	[Shakespeare Sonnets Data set](https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/sonnets/sonnet_view.php?range=viewrange&sonnetrange1=1&sonnetrange2=154)

## Tools
Programming language: **Python**  
Python libraries: **TensorFlow**, **NumPy**, **SciPy**  
Environment: **Google Colab Notebook**
